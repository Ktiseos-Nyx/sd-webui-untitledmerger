#currently supported calcmodes: weight_sum, add, sub, traindiff,extract

#You can select larger sections of the model using these base targets: "all", "clip", "unet", "in", "mid" and "out"
#you can further specify elements and blocks in a similar fashion to supergmerger, e.g. "IN07" is "in.7" in this, "IN07:attn2" is "in.7.attn2". Mre specific target override looser targets
#only parts of the model not targeted by the recipe will not be merged
targets:
  'all':
    add:
      alpha: slider_a #this can be a slider or a number 
      sources:
        checkpoint_a: model_a
        traindiff:
          sources:
            checkpoint_a: model_a
            checkpoint_b: model_b
            checkpoint_c: model_c
#additional models can be included in the merge by adding them to "checkpoints:":
#checkpoints:
# sd15: v1-5_pruned.fp16.safetensors
#
#the alias (sd15) is used instead of the filename to reference the model in the recipe
