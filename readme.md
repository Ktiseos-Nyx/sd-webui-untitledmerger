# Untitled Merger - Advanced Model Merging for Stable Diffusion

A powerful Stable Diffusion checkpoint merging extension with **15 merge algorithms**, **LoRA support**, and **intelligent caching**.

## üéâ Now Works on Forge!

This is an actively maintained fork of [groinge/sd-webui-untitledmerger](https://github.com/groinge/sd-webui-untitledmerger) with major updates and Forge compatibility!

### ‚ú® What's New in This Fork

- ‚úÖ **Forge Compatibility** - Works on both SD WebUI Forge AND A1111!
- ‚úÖ **6 New Merge Modes** - Added Triple Sum, Quad Sum, Multiply Difference, Sum Twice, Self, and Tensor modes
- ‚úÖ **LoRA Merging** - Merge LoRAs to checkpoints or combine multiple LoRAs
- ‚úÖ **Bug Fixes** - Fixed DARE (Power-up) division by zero crash
- ‚úÖ **4-Model Support** - Quad Sum mode finally uses all 4 model slots!

## üöÄ Features

### Advanced Merge Algorithms (15 Total!)

**Basic Modes:**
- **Weight-Sum** - Classic linear interpolation between two models
- **Self** - Multiply model weights by a scalar value

**Multi-Model Modes:**
- **Triple Sum** - Weighted blend of 3 models
- **Quad Sum** - Weighted blend of 4 models (NEW!)
- **Sum Twice** - Hierarchical two-stage merging

**Difference-Based Modes:**
- **Add Difference** - Add weighted difference: `A + (B-C) √ó Œ±`
- **Multiply Difference** - Multiplicative difference: `A √ó ((B-C) √ó Œ± + 1)` (NEW!)
- **Train Difference** - Treat difference as fine-tuning relative to base model

**Advanced Interpolation:**
- **Comparative Interp** - Adaptive interpolation based on value differences
- **Enhanced Manual Interp** - Manual threshold control for interpolation
- **Enhanced Auto Interp** - Automatic threshold calculation

**Research-Based Methods:**
- **Power-up (DARE)** - Drop And REscale from research papers (FIXED!)
- **Extract** - Merge common/uncommon features between models
- **Add Dissimilarities** - Add dissimilar features to base model

**Experimental:**
- **Tensor** - Swap entire tensors by probability instead of blending (NEW!)

### LoRA Support

- **Merge LoRA to Checkpoint** - Permanently bake a LoRA into a checkpoint with adjustable strength
- **Merge Multiple LoRAs** - Combine 2-3 LoRA files with custom weights

### Performance Features

- **Calculation Caching** - Reuses intermediate calculations to speed up subsequent merges
- **Multi-threading** - Configurable worker threads for parallel operations
- **Memory Efficient** - Smart caching with configurable size limits (0-16GB)

## üìã Requirements

- Stable Diffusion WebUI (A1111) **OR** Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge
- Only supports `.safetensors` format checkpoints
- Python 3.10+ with torch, safetensors, scipy (usually pre-installed)

## üéØ Compatibility

| Platform | Status | Tested Version |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| SD WebUI Forge | ‚úÖ Working | Latest (2024) |
| SD WebUI A1111 | ‚úÖ Working | 1.7.0 - 1.9.3+ |
| SD 1.5 Models | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | All variants |
| SDXL Models | ‚úÖ Generally Works | May have edge cases |

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Navigate to your WebUI extensions folder:
   ```bash
   cd stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/
   # OR for Forge:
   cd stable-diffusion-webui-forge/extensions/
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sd-webui-untitledmerger.git
   ```

3. Restart your WebUI

4. Look for the **"Untitled merger"** tab!

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Checkpoint Merging

1. Select your merge mode from the dropdown
2. Choose base models (2-4 depending on mode)
3. Adjust sliders for merge weights
4. Configure save options (fp16/bf16, autosave, etc.)
5. Click **Merge**!

### Advanced Features

- **Custom Sliders** - Per-block weight control for fine-grained merging
- **Include/Exclude Filters** - Regex-based layer targeting
- **Supermerger Adjust** - Fine-tune detail, contrast, brightness, and color
- **YAML Weight Editor** - Batch operations via configuration files

### LoRA Merging

- **LoRA ‚Üí Checkpoint:** Bake a LoRA into a model permanently
- **LoRA ‚Üí LoRA:** Combine multiple LoRAs with custom ratios

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

- Image generation tab intentionally removed (not needed for merging workflow)
- LoRA merging uses heuristic key matching (may need adjustment for exotic LoRAs)
- SDXL merging works but less tested than SD 1.5

---

## üìù To-Do List

- [ ] XYZ plotting for parameter exploration
- [ ] State saving and merge history
- [ ] Improve LoRA key matching for better compatibility
- [ ] Block weight presets compatible with Supermerger format
- [ ] Merge history logger
